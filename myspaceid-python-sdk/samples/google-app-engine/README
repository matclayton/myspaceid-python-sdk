Overview of the samples in this directory:
-------------------------------------------

	openid-combined-consumer:
	-------------------------
	This sample demonstrates an OpenID "Combined Consumer" by implementing the openid/oauth "hybrid" spec as specified at: 
	http://step2.googlecode.com/svn/spec/openid_oauth_extension/latest/openid_oauth_extension.html
	
	This sample also demostrates the interaction with MySpace using the MySpace library to fetch the user's profile and 
	friends data


	oauth:
	------
	This sample demonstrates an OAuth Consumer application by implementing the oauth delegated access flow ("3 legged oauth").
	Once the User authrizes the Consumer's request, it fetches the user's profile and friend information using the library. 

    NOTE: Please note that in the samples above we store the access token in the session. But, in a real application you would
          probably need to store it an the user database so that you can call the MySpace API methods in the future using the 
          stored access token

Running the sample applications:
--------------------------------  
	The samples provided in this directory are based on Google App Engine(GAE) and require the GAE SDK to run. 
	Some of the sample code in these directories in based on the GAE samples on code.google.com with modifications
	to implement the "hybrid" protocol.
	
	Please make sure to install the  Google App Engine SDK first from here (http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html) 
	before proceeding to run the sample applications.
	
	After you have verified that the GAE environment is properly setup, you can run the samples locally in your GAE environment.
	
	To run the samples, please follow these steps:
	
	   1. Go to http://developer.myspace.com/modules/apps/pages/CreateAppAccount.aspx to create a new MySpace application
	      NOTE: Make sure to select the "Create MySpaceID App" link and complete the application creation process
	      
	   2. Note down the newly created application's consumer key and secret.
	
	   3. cd to the directory of the sample you want to run. For example, cd myspaceidsdk/samples/google-app-engine/openid-combined-consumer
	
	   4. Edit the ckeynsecret.py file by inserting your own consumer key/secret noted in step 2 above.
	 
	   5. Copy the following SDK library folders from the myspace-python-sdk\src directory into the appropriate sample directory:
				myspace
				oauthlib
				openid
				simplejson
	
	   	 For example, to run the openid-combined-consumer application please copy the directories above to the openid-combined-consumer 
	     directory. Repeat the same for each of the sample applications. Please note that the same consumer key/secret can be used for
	     all the samples.
	    
	   6. Type " dev_appserver.py ." from the samples root directory. This should fire up your local instance of appengine and will start listening on port 8080
	   
	   7. You can access the sample from your browser by navigating to http://your-domain:8080
	 
	IMPORTANT: The domain on which you run your server MUST be entered as a realm on your MySpace app configuration page.  In order
	for the rails samples to work you MUST INCLUDE A SLASH AT THE END OF YOUR DOMAIN, e.g. http://your-domain:3000/, when you enter
	it as a realm.
